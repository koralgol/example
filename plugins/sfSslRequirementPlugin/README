= sfSslRequirement plugin (for symfony 1.1) =

The `sfSslRequirement` is a symfony plugin that provides SSL encryption support for your module actions.

It gives you 2 new security settings: `require_ssl` and `allow_ssl`.

The plugin also adds 2 new `sfAction` methods: `->sslRequired()` and `->sslAllowed()`.

== Logic ==

Only execute once per request and SF_ENVIRONMENT in one of the environments configured in app_disable_sslfilter
  * if not posting
   * if secured
    * then check if its allowed else redirect from https to http
    * else if secured required redirect from http to https

== Installation ==

  * Install the plugin

  {{{
    symfony plugin:install symfony/sfSslRequirementPlugin
  }}}

  * Activate the filter in your `filters.yml`

  {{{
    sfSslRequirement:
      class: sfSslRequirementFilter
  }}}

  * Clear your cache

  {{{
    symfony cc
  }}}

=== Secure your application ===

To force SSL on an action:

  * Add the following snippet to the module `security.yml`:

  {{{
    sslAction:
      require_ssl: true
  }}}

  * You're done. Now, if you try to access the `sslAction` with HTTP, you will be automatically redirected to HTTPS.
  * The `sslAction` listed here is an example.  Substitute with your actual action name.
